Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks, as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).
