System debugging and performance analysis often rely on [strace](https://strace.io/) to understand application behavior. However, existing tools typically fall short:

- **Limited scope**: Most tools only provide basic statistics or file access lists
- **No programmability**: Fixed output formats with no API for custom analysis
- **Poor multi-threading support**: Difficult to analyze concurrent syscall execution
- **No visualization**: Raw text output is hard to interpret for complex applications

**StraceTools bridges these gaps** by providing:
- âœ¨ **Comprehensive parsing** with full syscall detail extraction
- ðŸ”§ **Programmable API** for custom analysis workflows
- ðŸ“Š **Interactive visualizations** for timeline and process analysis
- ðŸ§µ **Multi-threading support** with process relationship tracking
