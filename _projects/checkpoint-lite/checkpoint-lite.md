`checkpoint-lite` provides a simple interface to checkpoint and restore running processes while capturing both their memory state and filesystem changes. Unlike heavyweight container solutions, this tool focuses on minimal overhead by directly orchestrating existing kernel features.

### Key Features
- **Hybrid State Capture**: Combines filesystem (OverlayFS) and memory (CRIU) checkpointing
- **Multi-Session Support**: Concurrent usage by multiple applications with isolated sessions
- **Minimal Overhead**: Direct system calls without unnecessary container abstractions
- **Simple CLI**: Straightforward command-line interface for checkpoint operations
- **Session Management**: Automatic cleanup and resource management
