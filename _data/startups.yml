    This talk shares lessons learned going from NLP researcher to building Noetica, a platform that analyzes populations of complex contracts to determine market standards for deal terms. Along the way I'll discuss (1) how LLMs have enabled a new opportunity space for hybrid systems that combine extraction capabilities with formal analytical frameworks, (2) how building these systems still requires deep fusion of subject-matter and technical judgment to identify tractable decompositions of seemingly impossible problems, and (3) how this converges to a new version of the Technical Product Manager role. This role is highly suited to technical researchers willing to tackle sector-specific challenges.

  bio: Thomas Bueler-Faudree is the co-founder of August, where he leads engineering and product. He earned a bachelor's degree in computer science and history from Columbia University. At Columbia he worked in the CRIS Lab and CML.
  description: |
    Modern document-heavy work in law, finance, and consulting is repetitive, bespoke, and review heavy. Code generation tools like Cursor have reshaped how developers work, but that shift has not happened in law. Legal tasks are hard to measure and even harder to "unit test," which is why many AI tools miss the mark.

    This talk shows how August is building agents that do better: the right indexing methods, visible state, disciplined tool use, and citations at every step to cleanly automate real professional workflows. We'll walk through a multi-step research agent (e.g., over SEC filings) that plans the task, retrieves the right sources, routes to the relevant sections, and drafts grounded legal answers.

    Attendees will leave with a lightweight design pattern for credence domains like law. We will also share our growth and go-to-market. We are productizing law-firm workflows and, in some cases, selling with the firm to their clients. This is a new model that is gaining traction across professional services.

    Autonomous warehouse systems represent one of the most advanced and large-scale examples of embodied multi-agent intelligence operating in the physical world. Thousands of mobile robots collaborate continuously to move, pick, and sort goods in dynamic, uncertain environments—achieving high efficiency, adaptability, and robustness in real time.

    In this talk, I will discuss how warehouse robotics offers both a practical foundation and conceptual inspiration for the design of AI systems. I will introduce the market context and technical underpinnings of large-scale robotic automation, then explore how intelligence emerges through coordination, perception, and control across distributed agents. I will also discuss how large language models (LLMs) may extend this paradigm—enabling natural language tasking, high-level reasoning, and seamless human–AI collaboration in embodied systems.

    Finally, I will reflect on how lessons from large-scale robotic coordination can inform the broader design of the warehouse automation ecosystems, highlighting new directions for research at the intersection of autonomy, learning, and collective intelligence.

  description:  |
    In this presentation, I will describe ongoing work at Traversal, where our team is developing an
    AI Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) designed to assist enterprises in diagnosing and mitigating
    production incidents, with the broader goal of improving the resilience of large-scale, mission-
    critical systems. I will outline why incident troubleshooting is rapidly becoming a central
    bottleneck in realizing end-to-end automation of the software development lifecycle (SDLC),
    particularly as organizations adopt increasingly complex cloud-native architectures and
    integrate AI-driven tooling across their operational workflows.
    
    From a research perspective, automated incident response represents a technically rich and
    largely underexplored problem space. I will highlight how it brings together challenges at the
    intersection of agentic system design, large language model evaluation, causal inference on
    unstructured data, and time-series modeling of high-dimensional telemetry. These domains
    converge in the task of enabling AI systems to form hypotheses, reason under uncertainty,
    and propose actionable remediations in environments characterized by incomplete information,
    noisy signals, and strict reliability constraints. Our goal in this work is not only to build a
    practical system, but also to surface open problems and novel research opportunities for the
    broader community.

    Engineer agents to help teams diagnose and remediate complex production incidents, and an
