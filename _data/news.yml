    Congratulations to Tianle Zhou on earning an Honorable Mention in the 2025-2026 CRA Outstanding

    and Prof. Kostis Kaffes. His research focuses on understanding how autonomous agents can be
    effectively supported in real-world, stateful system environments, as well as identifying the
    limitations that arise when such agents are deployed for complex, multi-step tasks.
