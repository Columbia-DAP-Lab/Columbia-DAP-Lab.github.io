- title: 'Disaggregated LLM Inference: Past, Present, and Future'

    Large language model (LLM) serving faces a fundamental challenge: the prefill 
    phase is compute-bound while the decode phase is memory-bound. Existing serving 
    systems co-locate these two phases and batch their computation across users 
    and requests, a strategy that not only introduces strong prefill–decode 
    interference but also couples resource allocation and parallelism choices across both phases.
    We introduce DistServe, a low-latency serving engine that assigns prefill and 
    decode computation to different GPUs, thereby eliminating interference between 
    the two. DistServe co-optimizes resource allocation and parallelism strategies 
    tailored for each phase, while placing them across the cluster to account for 
    bandwidth constraints and minimize the communication overhead introduced by 
    disaggregation. As a result, DistServe substantially improves serving performance, 
    measured as the maximum request rate that can be sustained under strict time-to-first-token (TTFT) 
    and time-per-output-token (TPOT) constraints.
    Since DistServe, disaggregation has moved into the spotlight of LLM inference, 
    with many companies and open-source projects adopting or extending this paradigm in practice. 
    We will also highlight related academic and open-source work that has emerged around 
    disaggregated inference, and reflect on the open challenges faced today as well 
    as the opportunities that lie ahead.

    The brains of computing systems today have increasingly been realized by 
    generative AI such as Large Language Models (LLMs) together with agentic 
    technologies. While the AI approaches are arguably more creative and cheaper 
    to develop, their safety becomes a fundamental challenge. Instead of using 
    another LLM as a judge or waiting for a provably trustworthy model to exist, 
    we may want to figure out how to build seatbelts and airbags for computing 
    systems driven by LLMs/agents. In this talk, I will share our preliminary 
    experience of developing a site reliability engineering (SRE) agent which 
    attempts to autonomously mitigate production system failures. I would also 
    discuss the potential of advanced system intelligence – AI that can 
    understand "systems" beyond code and reason about their safety properties.

    Despite its amazing success, leaderboard chasing has become something researchers dread and mock.
    When implemented properly and executed faithfully, leaderboard chasing can lead to both faster
    and easily reproducible progress in science, as evident from the amazing progress we have seen
    with machine learning, or more broadly artificial intelligence, in recent decades. It does not
    however mean that it is easy to implement and execute leaderboard chasing properly. In this talk,
    I will go over four case studies demonstrating the issues that ultimately prevent leaderboard
    chasing from a valid scientific approach. The first case study is on the lack of proper
    hyperparameter tuning in continual learning, the second on the lack of consensus on evaluation
    metrics in machine unlearning, the third on the challenges of properly evaluating the evaluation
    metrics in free-form text generation, and the final one on wishful thinking. By going over these
    cases, I hope we can collectively acknowledge some of our own fallacies, think of underlying
    causes behind these fallacies and come up with better ways to approach artificial intelligence research.

    AI agents hold great value for enterprises but are notoriously difficult to productionize in a
    robust and reliable way. Enterprise agents must internalize task context, constraints, and
    success metrics to be reliable, yet learning directly in production is risky and often infeasible.
    Veris is a simulation-first experiential learning platform for training and evaluating
    domain-specific AI agents through simulated experience. I will present how Veris constructs
    high-fidelity interactive environments that mirror target deployments, including tool APIs, data
    schemas, user behaviors, and organizational policies. Then I will discuss how Veris supports
    multiple post-training paths like RL with online rollouts and trajectory replay, and iterative
    prompt or policy optimization. Finally, I will outline current challenges and research opportunities.

    Efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial due
    to their substantial memory and computational demands. This seminar discusses
    recent advancements in techniques aimed at  significantly reducing these costs,
    enabling effective adaptation of large-scale models even on resource-constrained
    hardware. The talk will begin with an overview of current challenges and mainstream
    approaches to compressing and fine-tuning LLMs, highlighting trade-offs between
    model size, accuracy, and efficiency. Subsequently, the speaker will introduce
    novel approaches  that enable fine-tuning at extremely low precision and ultra-low
    parameter regimes,  significantly reducing memory requirements without compromising
    performance. Finally, the  discussion will cover recent progress and future
    directions for achieving efficient deployment  of LLMs in real-world applications.

- title: 'Multi-Agent Systems in the Era of LLMs: Testbeds, Applications, and Beyond'
  who: Yusen Zhang
  date: '2025-07-10'
  time: 12PM
  description: >
    Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are emerging
    as powerful tools for a  wide range of tasks. However, a single agent often
    faces performance ceilings, especially when  tackling complex workflows like
    running an AI company or AI4Research, and is inherently limited  in scenarios
    that involve multiple instances, such as simulations, embodied agents, and digital
    twins. In this talk, I will present Multi-Agent Large Language Models (MA-LLMs),
    a promising  paradigm designed to overcome the fundamental limitations of single-agent
    systems. I will begin  by highlighting three threads of my previous work that
    lay the groundwork for MA-LLMs. Next,  I'll introduce our research on fairness
    summarization, which demonstrates challenges that a  single agent struggles
    to handle well. Then, I will present how agents can collaborate in a  chain-of-agent
    manner to solve difficult tasks, such as long-document summarization and  multi-step
    reasoning. Finally, I will reflect on current limitations in MA-LLMs and outline
    my  long-term vision of building Agent Societies: a human-centric society consisting
    of scalable,  trustworthy, and collaborative intelligent agents and humans.

- title: From Serving LLMs to Serving Agents on the Cloud
  tag: Seminar
  date: '2025-07-24'
  time: 12PM
  who: Xiaozhe Yao
  description: >
    In this talk, I will discuss key challenges in building agentic AI systems in
    the cloud. I will highlight DeltaZip, our recent work on efficiently deploying
    multiple fine-tuned models -- a step we believe is essential toward enabling future
    AI systems. The core insight behind DeltaZip is that fine-tuning often introduces
    small-magnitude changes to a pre-trained model. By co-designing the serving system
    and compression algorithm, DeltaZip achieves a 2x to 12x throughput improvement
    over state-of-the-art systems. In addition to this project, I will share some
    ongoing challenges we are tackling in this space.

    Xiaozhe Yao is a third-year doctoral student at Systems Group, Department of Computer
    Science, ETH Zurich advised by Prof. Dr. Ana Klimović. His research explores the
    complex and fundamental tensions between three pillars: from optimizing systems
    for efficient ML, to improving data quality and organization for ML, to developing
    frameworks that bridge the gap between algorithms and their practical deployment.
    Through this multi-faceted approach, his work aims to better understand and build
    AI systems.

    LLMs have opened new possibilities of automated agents that plan and complete tasks on the
    user's behalf. Such agents have the potential to usher in a new industrial revolution by
    automating organizational processes. This graduate-level course will cut across the technology
    stack to examine the research questions that need to be answered for agents to be possible in
    real tasks that matter. Each session will review 1-3 papers or systems, and discuss research
    opportunities that arise from the gap between existing research and enterprise requirements.
    Topics will span systems (data systems and ML systems), AI (LLMs, agent-based planning), HCI,
    and theory (reinforcement learning, markets).
