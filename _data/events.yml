- title: 'Efficient Fine-Tuning and Compression of Large Language Models: Towards
    Low-bit and Ultra-Low Parameter Solutions'
  who: Jiajun Zhou
  date: '2025-07-07'
  time: 12PM
  description: "Efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial due\
    \ to their substantial memory and computational demands. This seminar discusses\
    \ recent advancements in techniques aimed at  significantly reducing these costs,\
    \ enabling effective adaptation of large-scale models even on resource-constrained\
    \ hardware. The talk will begin with an overview of current challenges and mainstream\
    \ approaches to compressing and fine-tuning LLMs, highlighting trade-offs between\
    \  model size, accuracy, and efficiency. Subsequently, the speaker will introduce\
    \ novel approaches  that enable fine-tuning at extremely low precision and ultra-low\
    \ parameter regimes,  significantly reducing memory requirements without compromising\
    \ performance. Finally, the  discussion will cover recent progress and future\
    \ directions for achieving efficient deployment  of LLMs in real-world applications.\
    \  \n\n\nJiajun Zhou is currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical\
    \ and Electronic  Engineering at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), supervised\
    \ by Prof. Ngai Wong, and a visiting  scholar at the University of California,\
    \ Santa Barbara (UCSB). He received his Master's degree  in IC Design Engineering\
    \ from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2019.  He\
    \ previously worked as a Research Assistant at the Chinese University of Hong\
    \ Kong (CUHK).  His research primarily focuses on developing innovative frameworks\
    \ for efficient training and  inference of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly\
    \ through quantization, low-bit  optimization, and tensor decomposition. He has\
    \ published extensively in AI and hardware  acceleration venues, including NAACL,\
    \ IEEE FCCM, and IEEE TCAD.\n"
- title: 'Multi-Agent Systems in the Era of LLMs: Testbeds, Applications, and Beyond'
  who: Yusen Zhang
  date: '2025-07-10'
  time: 12PM
  description: "Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are emerging\
    \ as powerful tools for a  wide range of tasks. However, a single agent often\
    \ faces performance ceilings, especially when  tackling complex workflows like\
    \ running an AI company or AI4Research, and is inherently limited  in scenarios\
    \ that involve multiple instances, such as simulations, embodied agents, and digital\
    \  twins. In this talk, I will present Multi-Agent Large Language Models (MA-LLMs),\
    \ a promising  paradigm designed to overcome the fundamental limitations of single-agent\
    \ systems. I will begin  by highlighting three threads of my previous work that\
    \ lay the groundwork for MA-LLMs. Next,  I'll introduce our research on fairness\
    \ summarization, which demonstrates challenges that a  single agent struggles\
    \ to handle well. Then, I will present how agents can collaborate in a  chain-of-agent\
    \ manner to solve difficult tasks, such as long-document summarization and  multi-step\
    \ reasoning. Finally, I will reflect on current limitations in MA-LLMs and outline\
    \ my  long-term vision of building Agent Societies: a human-centric society consisting\
    \ of scalable,  trustworthy, and collaborative intelligent agents and humans.\n\
    \nYusen Zhang is a fourth-year CS PhD student at Penn State University, advised\
    \ by Dr. Rui Zhang.  He has done industry research internships at Amazon, Microsoft,\
    \ and Google. He also worked  closely with Dr. Dragomir Radev. He received his\
    \ master's degree from Emory University,  advised by Dr. Jinho D. Choi. \n"

    questions

    3. a method to enhance users' prompt with domain-specific  knowledge bases.



    Yizheng Jiao graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with a doctoral degree in 2022. He
    joined Bytedance  after graduation and am doing research on LLM systems. His goal
    is to build efficient and  accurate LLM services with experience includes LLM
    inference systems, data selection for LLM  finetuning, and prompt optimization.
- title: From Serving LLMs to Serving Agents on the Cloud

  description: "    In this talk, I will discuss key challenges in building agentic\
    \ AI systems in the cloud. \n    I will highlight DeltaZip, our recent work on\
    \ efficiently deploying multiple fine-tuned models \n    -- a step we believe\
    \ is essential toward enabling future AI systems. The core insight behind \n \
    \   DeltaZip is that fine-tuning often introduces small-magnitude changes to a\
    \ pre-trained model. \n    By co-designing the serving system and compression\
    \ algorithm, DeltaZip achieves a 2x to 12x \n    throughput improvement over state-of-the-art\
    \ systems. In addition to this project, I will share \n    some ongoing challenges\
    \ we are tackling in this space.\n\n\n    Xiaozhe Yao is a third-year doctoral\
    \ student at Systems Group, Department of Computer Science, \n    ETH Zurich advised\
    \ by Prof. Dr. Ana KlimoviÄ‡. His research explores the complex and fundamental\
    \ \n    tensions between three pillars: from optimizing systems for efficient\
    \ ML, to improving data \n    quality and organization for ML, to developing frameworks\
    \ that bridge the gap between algorithms \n    and their practical deployment.\
    \ Through this multi-faceted approach, his work aims to better \n    understand\
    \ and build AI systems."
